        <p>I can't say too much right now because this is a public website and unfortuntely it will take me another day's worth of work to make it a private site so that you and I can both write notes on this, 
            but I created this site as a place for us to be able to write some quick memories and some nice notes to look back on. I'll also add a way for us to attach a picture to these notes so that we can have a memory of that as well.
            I have prepared some notes and some dates for the first iteration so you can see what the website should look like once we have multiple notes in place, hopefully there will be a lot more in the future. 
            I have to figure out a way to do this to protect our privacy tho haha so give me a bit. Anyways see you soonðŸ™‚
