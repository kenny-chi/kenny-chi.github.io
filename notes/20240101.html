        <p>Here goes nothing: I can't say too much right now because this is a public website and unfortuntely it will take me another day to migrate it and make it a private site so that you can I can both write notes on this, 
            but I created this site as a place for us to be able to write some quick memories and some nice notes to look back on. I'll also add a way for us to attach a picture to these notes so that we can have a memory of that as well.
            I have prepared some notes and some dates for the first iteration, hopefully there will be a lot more in the future. I have to figure out a way to do this to protect our privacy tho haha so give me a bit.
            Anyways see you soonðŸ™‚
